# CORE AND UTILITY VARIABLES
# ==========================
# The following variables are used by core and utility functions. These
# variables may be altered in site configuration script to alter the
# behaviour of the core and utility functions.

# Directory location where the rendered pages are written to. This is
# known as the site root of the website.
site_dir=_site

# Directory where cache files are written to. The cache files are used
# internally by this script to speed up certain rendering functions.
cache_dir=_cache

# Length of blog post snippets. The length is specified in number of
# words. The render_blog function truncates each post it encounters to
# snip_len number of words and caches the truncated post snippet in snip
# cache. The snip cache can then be used to render blog index, i.e. a
# page with a list of recent blog posts or a page with an archive of all
# blog posts.
snip_len=25


# PRIVATE VARIABLES
# =================
# The following variables may be used by any function in the script.
# Do not modify these variables in site configuration script.

# Newline character.

# CORE FUNCTIONS
# ==============
# The following core functions form the core API that may be invoked
# from the site configuration script (site.sh by default) to render a
# blog or website.


# DESCRIPTION
#   Read file, find and execute shell commands embedded in text and
#   replace each command with the standard output written by the
#   command. If the file uses a template, render it recursively such
#   that the 'content' command is replaced with the output of the file.
#   The output generated due to the last template processed is the
#   output of this function.
#
#   Limitation: This function may only be called from the site
#   configuration script. If a text being rendered invokes the render
#   function within embedded shell code, the behaviour is undefined.
#   This function must not be called from embedded shell code.
#
# OPERANDS
#   1. File to be rendered. (Optional)
#
# STDIN
#   The standard input is used as file if no file operand is specified.
#
# STDOUT
#   The rendered file is written to the standard output.
#
# STDERR
#   Any errors encountered while rendering are written to the standard
#   error.
#
# EXIT STATUS
#   0 If the file is rendered successfully.
#   1 If the rendering fails.

# Output cached rendered file after the first pass of rendering.
#
# When a file is rendered, it may undergo multiple passes of rendering.
# In the first pass, all embedded shell code in the file is rendered,
# but any template calls are not processed. This rendered file is cached
# in a location called p1 cache (p1 stands for the first pass).
#
# The template calls are processed in subsequent calls of rendering. The
# final rendered file is cached in a location called p2 cache (p2 stands
# for the second and subsequent passes). When there is no template call
# in the file, then the rendering is complete in the first pass itself.
# However, a p2 cache that is identical to p1 cache is created. This is
# created to ensure that one can always find the final rendered file in
# p2 cache regardless of the number of passes required to render the
# file.
#
# This function outputs the content of p1 cache that contains the
# rendered file without the file embedded in any template.
#
# OPERANDS
#   1. Path to the file that was rendered. If stdin was rendered, then
#      omit this operand to get p1 cache for rendered stdin.
#
# STDIN
#   Not used.
#
# STDOUT
#   The rendered file found in the p1 cache is written to the standard

# DESCRIPTION
#   Set base template for a content file being rendered.
#
#   A content file is a file that invokes the 'template' command. The
#   filename specified as argument to the 'template' command is known as
#   the template file.
#
#   This function must be called with the path to the template file as
#   its argument. The path must be relative to the directory where
#   oyster is run.
#
#   Once this function is called in a content file, the template file
#   specified as the argument is considered to be the base template for
#   the content file. The files are rendered according to the following
#   algorithm.
#
#     1. The content file is rendered first.
#     2. If the content file does not invoke the 'template' function,
#        then rendering is complete. No further steps are performed.
#     3. If the content file invokes the 'template' function, then
#        the template file is rendered.
#     4. Any occurrence of the 'content' function call in the template
#        file is replaced with the rendered content file.
#     5. Now assume the template file to be content file and go to step 2.
#
#   Note that a template file itself may be a content file if it
#   invokes the 'template' command.
#
# OPERANDS
#   1. Path to the template file relative to where oyster is run.

# DESCRIPTION
#   Render input text and include in the current text being rendered.
#   This function is similar to the render function with the following
#   exceptions:
#
#     1. This function may be called within embedded shell code.
#     2. This function ignores the template function call.
#
#   Therefore, this function cannot render any templates invoked within

#
# STDERR
#   Any errors encountered while rendering are written to the standard

# UTILITY FUNCTIONS
# =================
# The following utility functions form the utility API that may be
# invoked from the configuration script (site.sh by default).


# DESCRIPTION
#   Render a blog directory containing blog posts.
#
# OPERANDS
#   1. Path to source directory containing post files.
#   2. File pattern (glob) to search for post files.
#   3. Template to use to render files in source directory.
#      Use empty string, i.e. "", if a template is not to be used or if
#      the template is specified with template calls within the post
#      files.
#   4. Path relative to the site root of the website (site_dir) where
#      the rendered blog is to be made available. The path should begin
#      with a forward slash, i.e. "/". If the path does not begin with a
#      forward slash, then a forward slash is added automatically at the
#      beginning before using the path, thus both "blog" and "/blog"
#      would behave equivalently, i.e. both would cause this function to
#      place the rendered blog posts at $site_dir/blog/.
#
# STDIN
#   Not used.
#
# STDOUT
#   Progress details is written to the standard output.
#
# STDERR
#   Errors encountered while rendering is written to the standard error.
#
# EXIT STATUS
#   0 On success.
#   1 On failure.

#   Write RSS feed XML to the specified path.
#
# OPERANDS
#   1. Path to source directory of blog posts, e.g. "content/blog".
#   2. Number of posts to include in the RSS feed. If this operand is a
#      positive integer, then it indicates the number of posts to
#      render. If this operand is missing or if this operand is not a

#   3. Blog title, e.g. "My Blog".
#   4. Blog URL, e.g. "http://www.example.com/blog/".
#   5. Blog description, e.g. "My thoughts on technology".
#   6. Path relative to the site root of the website (site_dir) where
#      the rendered feed is to be made available. The path should begin
#      with a forward slash, i.e. "/". If the path does not begin with a

# DESCRIPTION
#   Output cached index of blog posts.
#
#   When render_blog function is used to render a directory of posts, an
#   index for all posts is created and cached. This index is a sequence
#   of lines with each line containing metadata about each post. Each
#   line is in the following format.
#
#     <date>:<url>:<filepath>:<title>
#
#   where
#
#     - <date> is the post creation date.
#     - <url> is the URL of the post relative to the site root.
#       <url> always begins with a forward slash.
#     - <filepath> is the path to the post file.
#     - <title> is the $post_title variable defined in the post file.
#
#   This function outputs this index in reverse sorted order, i.e. in
#   descending order of post creation dates. Therefore, newer posts
#   appear before older posts.

# DESCRIPTION
#   Output blog index as HTML.
#
#   When render_blog function is used to render a directory of posts, an

#   this index cache in HTML format. This function may be invoked from
#   embedded shell code of any page that wants to display a list of blog
#   posts.
#
#   This function must be called for a directory of post files only
#   after render_blog has been called for the same directory.
#
# OPERANDS
#   1. Path to source directory containing post files.
#   2. Number of posts to render. If this operand is a positive integer,

# DESCRIPTION
#   Print specified strings with trailing newlines removed.
#
#   The strings to print may be specified either as a single argument or
#   multiple arguments. When multiple arguments are specified, the
#   multiple arguments are joined with spaces in between and printed.
#
#   If no argument is specified, then this function accepts the string
#   to print from the standard input.
#
# OPERANDS
#   1. Strings
#
# STDIN
#   Text to print is read from standard input if no argument is
#   specified.
#
# STDOUT
#   Strings specified as arguments are printed with a space inserted
#   between each pair of arguments. If no arguments are specified, the
#   input text in the stanard input is printed.
#
# STDERR
#   Not used.
#
# EXIT STATUS
#   0 On success.
#   1 On failure.

# PRIVATE FUNCTIONS
# =================
# The following private functions are not part of the API. They should
# not be invoked directly by the configuration script.


# DESCRIPTION
#   Find shell code embedded in the input text, evaluate the shell
#   commands and replace the shell code with their output.
#
#   The input text is tokenized into two kinds of text:
#
#     1. Shell code delimited with shell code tags (default: '{{' and '}}').
#     2. Static text, i.e. any text that is not shell code.
#
#   Each block of shell code is executed and the block is replaced with
#   the standard output generated the shell code.
#
# OPERANDS
#   None.
#
# STDIN
#   The standard input is used as the file to be rendered.
#
# STDOUT
#   The rendered file is written to the standard output.
#
# STDERR
#   Any errors encountered while rendering are written to the standard
#   error.
#
# EXIT STATUS
#   0 If the file is rendered successfully.
#   1 If the rendering fails.
